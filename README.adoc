= Site (2.0) 

image::https://github.com/juxt-site/site/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg[float="right"]

With Site, you can build complete API services 100x quicker than by using traditional web frameworks.


Here's how you use Site:

* You write an API description, in https://swagger.io/specification/[OpenAPI] format.
* You set up a Site instance, running in on a machine you own, or with your cloud provider.
* Where necessary, you code some of the operations needed to serve the API.
* You deploy the API to your Site instance.

Site does the rest, which includes:

* Serving your API over proper HTTP, with proper method semantics, response codes, headers, conditional requests, caching and much more.
* Securing your API with OAuth2, with proper registration of clients, integration with authentication providers, declarative access control, scope and much more.
* Managing your data, provide data consistency guarentees, an audit trail, event logging and bitemporal data access.

You get to design your API exactly as you want it. Site does the rest.

== A better way of building APIs

Site is RESTful. Everything in Site is a web resource, with a URI which you can link to.
Web security is built in, not an afterthought.

== An 'application server' for today's web and mobile apps

Site is an *Application Data Platform*, allowing the deployment of Application Programming Interfaces to serve state to applications.

Site offers the following:

* Bitemporal data storage (via https://xtdb.com[XTDB])
* User authentication (including https://openid.net/[OpenID])
* Flexible access-control (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control[RBAC], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-based_access_control[ABAC] and policy-based)
* Support for https://www.openapis.org/[OpenAPI] programmable APIs, with an https://github.com/babashka/SCI[embedded powerful language].
* A built-in OAuth2 Authorization Server for issuing access tokens
* Excellent conformance with standards (HTTP, OAuth2, OpenID) to maximise interoperability and minimize lock-in

On top of these features, Site has strong support for data governance.
Every state of the database is accessible at any point in time.
Every change to the database is auditable, so you can find out who made which change to the data, and when.

=== OAuth2

Site fully implements the https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749[OAuth2 Authorization Framework].
Site assumes the roles of a Resource Server and Authorization Server.

=== Internal Developer Platforms

Site can be adopted as part of an https://internaldeveloperplatform.org/[Internal Developer Platform (IDP)].

== Status

Site 2.0 is not yet ready for evaluation outside of JUXT, and is in
the process of maturing. We are developing 'in the open', please treat
this repository in that spirit.

The previous 1.0 generation of Site is maintained at https://github.com/juxt/site.

== Which types of projects might I use Site for?

* You want to get started on a project quickly, and there are
  requirements for the project to serve data securely over an API.

* You are building an Internal Developer Platform (IDP) and want to
  provide a solution to your developers to help them speed their
  development of APIs.

* You have a dataset that you want to make available to
  consumers/customers via a secure OAuth2-compliant API, but don't
  want to build a system from scratch.

In these cases, https://juxt.pro[JUXT] can provide expert guidance, consulting and
development resources, if required. Contact info@juxt.pro to schedule
an appointment.

==  Site with Docker

From a terminal, run the following:

----
docker run --net host ghcr.io/juxt-site/site-server
----

TIP: You can replace docker with podman

From another terminal:

----
alias site='docker exec -it $(docker ps -qf ancestor=ghcr.io/juxt-site/site-server) site'
----

Now initialise Site and follow the instructions:

----
site init
----

Request a token

----
site request-token --client-secret (as instructed)
----

Continue with the https://github.com/juxt-site/book/blob/master/GettingStarted/ConfigurationWithCommandLine.adoc[Getting Started Guide].

== Documentation

The latest PDF documentation for Site can be found at https://github.com/juxt-site/book/releases/download/latest/Site.pdf.
The source code to the documentation is in another repository: https://github.com/juxt-site/book.

== Testing

Run the tests with `make test` if you have make installed, or if not, with `clojure -M:test -m kaocha.runner test`.

== Technical Description

Site is a standards-compliant web server, fulfilling the roles of an https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749[OAuth2] resource server and authorization server.

[quote,https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-1.1]
--
resource server:: The server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.
--

Resources are documents which represent a resource's identity (URI), configuration and current state (which might be some data, image or other media).
Site stores resources in a database.

A resource request is a standard web request to a URI (as part of an API, such as https://www.openapis.org/[OpenAPI]).

Requests contain an access-token, acquired from an authorization server:

[quote,https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-1.1]
--
authorization server:: The server issuing access tokens to the client
after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining
authorization.
--

Currently, the only supported database is JUXT's immutable https://xtdb.com[XTDB] database.
XTDB is a good fit for Site, since many of its features (such as document ids and references) map cleanly onto web concepts (such as URIs and links).

== Features

Current development is still focussed on the technical feature set, as required to conform to the relevant standards and provide good interoperability.

=== Resource Server

* Content Negotiation
* Conditional Requests
* Access Control (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control[RBAC], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-based_access_control[ABAC] or policy based)

=== Authorization Server

* Client Registration
* User Authentication (Basic, Login form, OpenID)
* OAuth2 access token grants

== Programming Site

Some types of resource, such as 'operations', may contain Site 'programs' that are executed when required.
All resources are stored in the database, including all program code.

Currently, the only available programming language is https://github.com/babashka/sci/[SCI].

== Consulting

Contact info@juxt.pro if you would like help, we can provide professional consulting services for Site and/or XTDB.
