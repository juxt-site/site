    ;; idea to restrict the ability for operations to make general queries
    ;; against the database. By only exposing API functions such as
    ;; pull-allowed-resources to this SCI script, we can limit the power of
    ;; operations thereby securing them. This is preferable to limiting the
    ;; ability to deploy operations to a select group of highly authorized
    ;; individuals.

    ;; TODO: Go through the use-cases which already make general lookups
    ;; and queries to XT and see if we can rewrite them to use a more
    ;; restricted API.
