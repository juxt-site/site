= Permissions

These permissions allow unrestricted, and sometimes anonymous, access
to their corresponding operations.

These permissions should not depend on their operations. Instead,
since these permissions are required by their operations, they are
depended upon by their operations.

If any of these permissions depend on their operations, a recursive
dependency loop will occur. Currently, Site does not code a defense
against such infinite loops.
